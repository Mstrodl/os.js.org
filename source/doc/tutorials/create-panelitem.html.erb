<h1>Tutorial: Create your own Panel Item</h1>

<p>
  You basically just have to copy one of the existing items (like <i>Clock</i>) and use it as a template. It is just one CSS file and one JS file.
</p>
<p>
  Or if you want to create your own from scratch, extend <b>OSjs.Applications.CoreWM.PanelItem</b> and add it to the namespace <b>OSjs.Applications.CoreWM.PanelItems</b>
</p>
<p>
  Include your files in either CoreWM manifest or in build.json
</p>
