<h1>Configuring and building</h1>

<p>
  You can find all the configuration files in <b>src/conf</b> directory.
</p>
<p>
You can create your own files to override these. Just create (ex) <b>900-custom.json</b> and place which settings there (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andersevenrud/OS.js-v2/master/src/templates/conf/900-custom.json">example</a>).
</p>

<p>
  If you make any changes, issue this command to rebuild configuration files:
</p>
<pre>grunt config</pre>

<h1>Building OS.js</h1>

OS.js has two build directories.

<h2>dist</h1>

<p>
  This is the production build of OS.js. All files have been compiled into single files (and can be compressed) to increase loading speed. This will however make it harder to debug.
</p>

<p>
  To build simply do:
</p>
<pre>grunt all</pre>

<h2>dist-dev</h1>

<p>
  This is what you should use when developing or testing changes.
</p>

<p>
  You don't need to run any commands to update source files, since they are loaded directly.
</p>
