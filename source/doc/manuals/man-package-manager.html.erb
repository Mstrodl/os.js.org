<h1>Managing system packages/applications</h1>

<p>
  To add a repository, simply clone and add the directory name to a list.
</p>

<pre class="code">
git clone --recursive https://github.com/username/package-repository src/packages/package-repository
</pre>

<p>
  Then simply add it to the "repositories" array in <i>src/conf/000-base.json</i> (or <a href="/doc/manuals/man-configuration.html">create your own configuration file</a>)
</p>

<p>
  If you want to remove a repository, simply delete the directory or remove it from the list
</p>

<!--
<p>
  You can use the built-in tools to add and remove custom packages
</p>
<pre class="code">

# Clone and add to list
./obt repositry clone foobar https://github.com/username/package-repository

# Or if you want to add a custom folder of packages
cp /path/to/packages src/packages/my-repo-name
./obt repositry add my-repo-name

# Clone and add to list
./obt repositry clone foobar https://github.com/username/package-repository

# Or if you want to add a custom folder of packages
cp /path/to/packages src/packages/my-repo-name
./obt repositry add my-repo-name

# Then remove with
./obt repository remove foobar

# Or delete entirely with
./obt repository delete foobar

</pre>

<p>
  Remember to update manifest with <b>grunt manifest</b>. And if you are planning on deploying or creating a dist build: <b>grunt packages</b>
</p>

<h1>Managing user packages</h1>
<p>
  You can install packages via the <b>Settings</b> application. To remove one simple delete the directory from the <i>Packages</i> folder in your home directory and refresh the metadata.
</p>
<p>
  Currently it supports zip files as a method of installation. Also has a simple, but working app store.
</p>
